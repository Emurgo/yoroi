# i18n setup

Internationalization is managed following the same approach described in
`yoroi-frontend` i18n [README](https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-frontend/blob/develop/app/i18n/README.md).
Please refer to that file for more information (just keep in mind that
`yoroi-mobile` has its own folder to store locale data).
