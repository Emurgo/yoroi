A simple, secure and fast Cardano ADA wallet.
English / 日本語 / 한국어 / Pусский

Yoroi allows users to manage ADA on their phone. It is a lightweight wallet that launches quickly, allowing users to start sending or receiving ADA in minutes.

The Yoroi Android App is small and can be downloaded without using much bandwidth. Additionally, Yoroi is a light wallet, which means it does not require a full copy of the blockchain to be stored on the user's device. This means the bandwidth requirements for using the wallet are also low.

Private keys associated with user wallets are only stored locally on the user's device, and this data is encrypted with a wallet password. Private keys are never stored on any centrally-hosted servers.

With support in four languages, Yoroi makes it easier than ever to manage your ADA.
